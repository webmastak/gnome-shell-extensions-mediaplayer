# Community Conduct Guidlines

Much like a good many other opensource projects this is not a democracy. At best it's a meritocracy, at worst it's a dictatorship. At any point you are unhappy with the direction that it's going you are free to fork it and go your own way.

Other than that basically just be cool. If you're cool I'll be cool and we're all cool. Cool? Do we really need any other rules?
